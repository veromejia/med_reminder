# MedReminder
## Description
MedReminder is a web application that can send text message to patients who needed reminder to take their medication daily. User can enter the recipient's information and fill out a reminder page which allows the app to know what medication, the frequency and also the duration of this medication for each recipient.
## Inspiration
Veronica's mother has diabetes and she continously asked Veronica to send a text as a reminder to take her medication daily, but Veronica can not keep track of that since she is occupied with her busy schedule as well. This is when the idea of MedReminder emerged.
